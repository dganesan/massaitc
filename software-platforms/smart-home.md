The Physical or Functional activities, behavioral monitoring, and safety be tracked through at-home sensor implementations for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). These home sensors allow non-intrusive data collection, providing caregivers and healthcare professionals with insights into the daily living activities and needs of ADRD patients. Here are a few examples of at-home sensors that are used for at-home data collection.

Motion Sensors: Track movement throughout the home, helping to monitor activity levels and detect any unusual patterns that might indicate a fall or wandering. Examples: Philips Hue Motion Sensor, Samsung SmartThings Motion Sensor.

Door and Window Sensors: To alert caregivers and family members when a door or window is opened, which is particularly useful for tracking individuals with cognitive decline who may wander or leave the house unsupervised. Examples: Eve Door & Window, SimpliSafe Entry Sensor.

Bed and Chair Pressure Mats:  To detect when an individual gets up from a bed or chair, which can help monitor sleep patterns, restlessness, or the risk of falling. Example: Smart Caregiver Corporation Cordless Bed Sensor Pad, Ideal Security Solo Pressure Mat Alarm.

Smart Appliance Monitors: It helps to detect whether appliances have been left on, potentially preventing accidents. This includes sensors for stoves, faucets, and other household appliances.
Examples: iGuardStove Intelligent Stove Safety Device, Fibaro Flood Sensor for detecting water leaks.

Video Monitoring Systems: Video cameras allow caregivers and family members to visually check in on individuals, ensuring they are safe and well. However, privacy is a concern and many companies provide shielding of cameras for protecting the privacy of the users. Examples: Arlo Pro.

Integration Platforms can integrate many of these at-home sensors providing centralized monitoring and control. Examples Amazon Alexa, Google Home. Samsung SmartThings Hub allows you to connect all of your different smart locks, lights, outlets, thermostats, and more so that you can receive important notifications about what's happening in and around your home and remotely control your home's security, energy usage, lighting, and more.
