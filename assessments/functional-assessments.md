## Functional Assessments

### Activities of Daily Living (ADL)

The basic activities of daily living (ADLs) can be defined as the fundamental skills required to care for yourself and remain independent. As the name implies, these tasks are done every day. These are sometimes referred to as functional activities of daily living. The assessment evaluates the individual’s ability to perform everyday tasks, such as bathing, dressing, and eating. Examples include the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (6 ADLs), [7] and 5 Activities of Daily Living. 

### Five Times Sit to Stand Test

The five Times Sit to Stand Test (5x Sit-To-Stand Test) is commonly abbreviated as 5XSST. It's used to assess functional lower limb strength, transitional movements, balance, and fall risk in older adults. The 5XSST scoring is based on the amount of time (to the nearest decimal in seconds) a patient can transfer from a seated to a standing position and back to sitting five times. The equipment needed in performing the 5XSST test includes a stopwatch and standard height chair with a straight back (43-45 cm, 17-18 inches high), that should be freestanding. Then the instruction is given by asking the test taker to sit on the chair by resting their back. Also, the test taker is instructed to fold their arms across their chest. Then the test taker should be instructed to sit-to-stand five times, as quickly as possible, at the count of go and without their back or leg resting on the chair between the interval of repetition. The timer should start when the examiner says "start" and stop when the individual's buttocks touch the seat of the chair after the last repetition. The inability to complete five repetitions without assistance or use of upper extremity support indicates failure of the test, any modifications should be documented. The lower the time to complete the test the better the outcome of the test. The Minimal Detectable Change(MDC) time for the test is between 3.6 to 4.2 seconds, and the Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is 2.3 seconds[8]. Also, the age-matched norms score is 11.4 seconds for 60-69 years age groups and 12.6 seconds and 14.8 seconds for 70-79 and 80-89 years of age group, respectively.

### Short Physical Performance Battery

The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is an objective assessment tool for evaluating lower extremity functioning in older persons. It was developed by the National Institute on Aging and is available for use without permission or royalty fees. A mobile application to streamline delivery of the SPPB and designed for research and clinical use is available for both iPhone and Android.  You can learn more about the SPPB and find links to the app at www.SPPBguide.com.
