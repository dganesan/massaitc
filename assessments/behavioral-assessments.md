## Behavioral and Psychological Assessments

Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) and significantly impact the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. Assessing these symptoms is crucial for effective management and treatment planning. Several tools and assessments have been developed to evaluate the behavioral and psychological aspects of ADRD.

### Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)

This is a tool used to assess agitation in dementia patients, covering a range of agitated behaviors such as physical aggression, verbal aggression, and non-aggressive behavior. Allows for the systematic recording of agitation symptoms, aiding in the evaluation of interventions designed to reduce agitation.

### Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)

Assesses behavioral changes and psychiatric symptoms in dementia, including depression, anxiety, aggression, and apathy.

### Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)

Used to screen for depression in older adults, including those with cognitive impairment. Although not specific to dementia, the GDS is a screening tool used to identify depression in older adults. It is simple to administer and consists of yes/no questions related to depressive symptoms. 

### Dementia Mood Assessment Scale (DMAS)

This scale assesses mood swings in dementia patients, focusing on variability and severity of mood symptoms. It helps in monitoring mood changes over time, which is critical for managing BPSD effectively.

### PHQ9

The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) [7], offers psychologists concise, self-administered tools for assessing depression. They incorporate DSM-IV depression criteria with other leading major depressive symptoms into a brief self-report instrument that is commonly used for screening and diagnosis, as well as selecting and monitoring treatment.

### Rating Scale for Aggressive Behaviour in the Elderly (RAGE)

The rating scale for aggressive behavior [8] is to measure aggressive behaviors in the elderly, ranging from simply being uncooperative or resisting help to actual physical violence.  There are numerous explanations for such behaviors. However, it is important not to be concerned with these reasons, but only with the actual behavior. Thus it is essential for you (the rater) to be totally objective in the rating, taking care not to interpret the patient’s motives. One needs to be objective in reporting. A rater can be any member of the ward staff involved in the day-to-day care of the patient.  Keeping in mind the importance of the rater having a 3-day observation period. ​​It is also important not to overlook minor behaviors, and not to judge the intention of the patient—ratee.  Aggression does not connote any desire or intention to hurt. It is important to note all behaviors and records to be thorough and representative of the patient’s clinical state.
