## Assessment Instruments for Cognitive Function & Behavior

The ubiquity of smartphones and tablets has led to a shift from traditional lab-based cognitive assessments to remote testing. Traditional cognitive testing typically occurs in controlled lab or clinic-based settings, where participants complete pen-and-paper tests. This method ensures a standardized environment but fails to capture the complexities of cognitive function over time and across different contexts. In contrast, remote testing via smartphones offers significant advantages including increased accessibility, enabling a broader and more diverse participant pool. It also supports continuous monitoring, which helps in detecting subtle cognitive changes and understanding variable interactions more effectively. Moreover, remote testing can reduce logistical costs and can boost participant engagement through gamified elements. 

Despite these benefits, challenges such as device compatibility, data security, and ensuring participant compliance without direct supervision remain. Several platforms have recently become available to facilitate studies that perform remote cognitive assessments. We describe a few platforms that pilots can explore further.

### NeuroUX

NeuroUX facilitates cognitive and behavioural data collection for clinical and academic studies using mobile technologies. Their platform offers validated cognitive tests including memory, psychomotor tests, executive function, emotion and social recognition, and attention. In addition to mobile cognitive tests, they also support EMAs, passive data collection from smartphone sensors (including GPS location), and Fitbit integration. They also support custom development and enhancements to their app.

### Xpresso from MoCA

Xpresso from MoCA is a test that was designed by the group that developed the MoCA Test—or Montreal Cognitive Assessment— which is a widely adopted medical screening test used by healthcare professionals for early detection of cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). XpressO is a smartphone and tablet version that is designed to quickly test memory and brain performance on an individual’s own device. The test takes about 7 minutes and assesses processing speed, executive function and memory and provides a performance score stating low or elevated risk of cognitive decline. The test was validated to have strong association with standard MoCA (~85\% accuracy in predicting MoCA score of < 25/30)
