## Chapter 2: Designing a Pedometer and Calorie Counter

Pedometers or step counters are now popular as an everyday exercise progress monitor and motivator. The increasing popularity of these devices can be attributed to several reasons. First, many people are known to overestimate their level of activity, hence these devices can provide more reliable feedback to an individual about how much or little they move during the day. Second, they provide instant and constant feedback about activity levels, making it possible to “gamify” by providing credits for every step an individual takes. Third, they can encourage individuals to compete with themselves in getting fit and losing weight.
