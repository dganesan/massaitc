## Software Platforms for Remote Pilot Studies involving Sensors, EMAs, and Digital Recruitment 

### Care Evolution

CareEvolution MyDataHelps is a platform for remote trials. The platform allows users to build surveys, schedule real-time notifications, launch projects, and digitally recruit participants without need to program. Participants join projects via the MyDataHelps app (available on iOS, Android, and web) to provide real-world participant health data from wearables, devices with EHR data, and EMAs. MyDataHelps integrates with a variety of wearable platforms including Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin, and others, as well as survey platforms such as RedCAP. They offer a free  account which allows you to invite and enroll up to 100 participants in your project.

### Radar-AD

RADAR-base is an open-source platform used for horizontally-scalable remote data collection. The main function of RADAR-base is to provide modular tools for the integration of data streams from various sources (i.e. wearables, phones, apps, IoT etc) and to collect in real time, process, store, manage and share the data with researchers.
