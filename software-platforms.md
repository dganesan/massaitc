## Software Platforms for Remote Pilot Studies involving Sensors, EMAs, and Digital Recruitment 

The importance of having a software infrastructure that is capable of managing remote clinical trials cannot be overstated. These platforms facilitate a variety of critical functions including participant recruitment, integration with wearables, smartphones and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the deployment of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) and digital surveys such as RedCAP, and running different types of assessments. Effective software solutions can greatly simplify the time and effort to roll out a remote pilot study.

### Care Evolution

CareEvolution MyDataHelps is a platform for remote trials. The platform allows users to build surveys, schedule real-time notifications, launch projects, and digitally recruit participants without need to program. Participants join projects via the MyDataHelps app (available on iOS, Android, and web) to provide real-world participant health data from wearables, devices with EHR data, and EMAs. MyDataHelps integrates with a variety of wearable platforms including Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin, and others, as well as survey platforms such as RedCAP. They offer a free  account which allows you to invite and enroll up to 100 participants in your project.

### Radar-AD

RADAR-base is an open-source platform used for horizontally-scalable remote data collection. The main function of RADAR-base is to provide modular tools for the integration of data streams from various sources (i.e. wearables, phones, apps, IoT etc) and to collect in real time, process, store, manage and share the data with researchers.
