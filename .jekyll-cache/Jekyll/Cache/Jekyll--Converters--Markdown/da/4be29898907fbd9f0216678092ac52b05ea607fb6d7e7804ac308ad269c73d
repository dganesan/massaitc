<h2 id="sampling-rate-and-nyquist-frequency">Sampling Rate and Nyquist Frequency</h2>

<p>Signals in the real world are continuous but for a computer to process the signals, they need to be sampled at a particular rate. For example, the accelerometer on your Fitbit may be sampling at 50Hz i.e. every 0.2 seconds in-order to detect steps. The choice of sampling rate has important implications on how we choose the smoothing window sizes and in particular the maximum frequency that can be filtered using frequency domain methods.</p>

<p>4.1  Nyquist Sampling Theorem
The answer may surprise you and involves one of the most fundamental (and interesting) theorems in signal processing: the Nyquist Sampling Theorem, which states that a continuous signal can be reconstructed as long as there are two samples per period for the highest frequency component in the underlying signal.</p>

<p>That is, for a perfect reconstruction, our digital sampling frequency  𝑓𝑠  must be at least twice as fast as the fastest frequency in our continuous signal:  𝑓𝑠=2∗𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑎𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞) .</p>

<p>For example, imagine we have an analog signal composed of frequencies between 0 and 2,000 Hz. To properly digitize this signal, we must sample at  2∗2,000𝐻𝑧 . So,  𝑓𝑠  needs to be 4,000Hz.</p>

<p>Now imagine that the fastest our digitizer can sample is 6,000 Hz: what frequency range can we properly capture? Since we need a minimum of two samples per period for proper reconstruction, we can only signals that change with a frequency of 0 to a maximum of 3,000Hz. This 3,000Hz limit is called the Nyquist rate or Nyquist limit: it is  12  the sampling rate  𝑓𝑠 .</p>

<p>For many applications related to Human-Computer Interaction and Ubiquitous Computing, sampling at 4kHz is more than sufficient. This enables analysis of any signal between 0-2kHz. Human motion—ambulatory movement, limb motion, finger gestures, etc.—simply does not change that fast. Even electroencephalograms (EEG), which measure electrical activity in the brain, are often sampled at 500-1000Hz. However, for recording sound (humans can hear between ~0-20kHz), faster sampling rates are necessary.</p>
