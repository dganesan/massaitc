## CS328: Mobile Health Sensing and Analytics

Fitness gadgets such as ​Fitbit​, ​Apple Watch,​ ​Android Wear,​ and smartphone apps such as ​RunKeeper​ and M​oves​ calculate activity patterns, calories burned each day, track sleep patterns, and compute heart rate. We will learn how to build the computational elements for developing such applications by leveraging various sensors on smartphones, including the accelerometer, camera, microphone, and GPS. This is a hands-on course where students learn by doing! 

#### Preliminaries: Python Basics [[html](CS328_Python_Basics.html)] [[ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hheScRsp3Dy-mkJ1xu-EMPPwyhMAbytN?usp=sharing#scrollTo=0uJ1tEU1CtpR)]
This notebook gives you an introduction to the main building blocks that will be useful for class including working with multidimensional arrays in [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) and visualizations using  using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), a powerful visualization library. Open this notebook, learn about creating basic charts, and try to build some of your own.
