## Practical Issues in Implementation of mHealth studies for Older Adults

Fitness gadgets such as ​Fitbit​, ​Apple Watch,​ ​Android Wear,​ and smartphone apps such as ​RunKeeper​ and M​oves​ calculate activity patterns, calories burned each day, track sleep patterns, and compute heart rate. We will learn how to build the computational elements for developing such applications by leveraging various sensors on smartphones, including the accelerometer, camera, microphone, and GPS. This is a hands-on course where students learn by doing! 

### Introduction

Conducting a mobile health (mHealth) study involving older adults, particularly those with dementia and their caregivers, presents several challenges that requires a deep understanding of various complex aspects from clinical knowledge to technical expertise in sensors and AI, to the use of a variety of mobile and IoT platforms. This complexity is magnified by the need to use different tools and methodologies that can reliably capture and interpret multi-modal data obtained from sensors and assessments.

We outline some key components of running an mHealth study with older adults and tools available to reduce the burden of developing the infrastructure needed to execute such a study/

### [Recruitment of ADRD Dyads](recruitment.html) 
Recruiting participants, particularly dyads of dementia patients and their caregivers, is crucial and challenging. This involves not only identifying and engaging suitable candidates but also ensuring their commitment for the duration of the study. Strategies to maintain participation and compliance are critical for collecting valid and reliable data. [More about recruitment strategies](recruitment.html).

### [Software Infrastructure](software.html) 
Effective data collection from wearables and home sensors relies on robust software infrastructure. This infrastructure must support seamless data integration, real-time processing, and user-friendly interfaces for both researchers and participants. [Detailed exploration of software solutions](software.html).

### [Assessment Instruments for Cognitive Function & Behavior](assessment.html) 
Utilizing the right assessment tools to measure cognitive and behavioral changes in dementia is vital. These tools must be sensitive enough to detect subtle changes over time, contributing to the overall understanding of the progression and management of the disease. [Further information on assessment instruments](assessment.html).

### [Survey Instruments](EMA.html) 
Implementing Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) via smartphones allows for the collection of real-time data on participants' behavior and symptoms in their natural environments. This method reduces recall bias and provides a more accurate representation of daily functioning. [Insights into survey methods](EMA.html).

### [Sensor Signal Processing and Noise Removal](signal-processing.html) 
The accuracy of data collected from sensors can be significantly impacted by noise and other extraneous signals. Effective signal processing techniques are essential to filter out these disturbances and extract meaningful information from the raw data. [Techniques for signal processing](signal-processing.html).

### [AI and Machine Learning Models](AI-ML.html) 
Developing AI models to interpret time-series and multi-modal sensor data can uncover patterns that human observers might miss. These models are crucial for predicting disease progression and potentially offering insights into personalized care strategies. [Advancements in AI and machine learning](AI-ML.html).

### [Study Design and IRB](study-design.html) 
Designing an mHealth study involves careful planning to ensure the study's scientific validity while protecting the rights and well-being of participants. This includes obtaining approval from Institutional Review Boards (IRB), which scrutinize the study design, the informed consent process, and the safety measures for participants.
