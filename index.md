## Welcome to GitHub Pages


#### [Lesson 4: Introduction to Smoothing and Filtering](chapter1-noise/Chapter1-SmoothingFiltering.html) ([ipynb](https://github.com/dganesan/mhealth-course/blob/gh-pages/chapter1-noise/Chapter1-3D-Trajectory-Smoothing.ipynb))

For visualizing our data, we'll be using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)—an incredibly powerful visualization library with a bit of an eccentric API (thanks to Matlab). Open this notebook, learn about creating basic charts, and try to build some of your own.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dganesan/mhealth-course/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dganesan/mhealth-course/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
