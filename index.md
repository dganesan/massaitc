## CS328: Mobile Health Sensing and Analytics

Fitness gadgets such as ​Fitbit​, ​Apple Watch,​ ​Android Wear,​ and smartphone apps such as ​RunKeeper​ and M​oves​ calculate activity patterns, calories burned each day, track sleep patterns, and compute heart rate. We will learn how to build the computational elements for developing such applications by leveraging various sensors on smartphones, including the accelerometer, camera, microphone, and GPS. This is a hands-on course where students learn by doing! The course will include coverage of the following topics. 

** Sensor data smoothing and denoising
** Design of a pedometer and calorie counter using your smartphone
** Recognition of everyday activities using inertial sensors on your smartphone
** Evaluating classifier performance using cross-validation
** Quantified self and personal data analytics
** Voice-based health analytics
** Physiological sensing using wearable sensors
** GPS clustering to understand mobility patterns
** Measuring sleep using wearable devices

This notebook gives you an introduction to the main building blocks that will be useful for class including working with multidimensional arrays in [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) and visualizations using  using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), a powerful visualization library. Open this notebook, learn about creating basic charts, and try to build some of your own.
